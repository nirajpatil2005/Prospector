It was not easy and the team has worked very hard to reach the target. - IT Manager, A Fortune 500 Retail Company Our new solar business unit needed an ERP system deployed within 60 days, and it needed to be cloud-based and turnkey since internal IT resources were limited. Additional time for business-process modeling was not an option. Despite these challenges, Sonata came through big time to meet our timeline requirements. - CIO, US Energy Firm Over the years as our business grew, so did our dependency on technology. We had invested in a lot of customization to our existing applications to automate our mission-critical functions. What we needed was a futuristic application, an all-encompassing one that would help us in digital transformation and set us up to win in a competitive landscape. We needed this to be done with minimal disruption to existing operations. Thanks to Sonata’s team the transformation was smooth, and we were able to go live in eight months. Moving to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 F & O cloud-based solution has helped us to transform, and we are able to engage with our ecosystem, experiencing cost benefits without compromising performance or reliability.

Fluidic Intelligence is how we help you unlock that momentum and sustain it at scale. Our promise? At least a 20% uplift in productivity and speed in your business. Three levels at which Fluidic Intelligence operates We work at the intersection of engineering, technology, and the enterprise. We use AI-native engineering to eliminate friction and maintain enterprise flow. Engineering Human and AI collaboration Engineering is evolving. AI no longer just helps us write code; it shapes how we design, test, and improve systems. Engineers are becoming system thinkers, creating spaces where human judgment and AI work together effectively. Technology AI grounded in real enterprise knowledge Enterprises carry years of hard-won knowledge, but it often sits in silos. Fluidic Intelligence brings it together through strong technology foundations and practical AI. The result is AI that understands how the enterprise really works, not just what the data says. Enterprise Intelligence in flow across the enterprise At the enterprise level, intelligence flows to the right models, systems, and people. Decisions and actions move smoothly across teams and processes, removing the friction that once slowed everything down. We remove barriers between people, data, and decisions, creating a zero-friction enterprise that adapts faster and executes with clarity. Fluidic Intelligence is AI-native transformation without reinvention. We do not reinvent, we unlock. We do not replace, we elevate. We embed AI at the precise points where your organization’s intelligence is blocked, releasing trapped potential and creating new flows of capability. From pilots to production, from promise to performance. In months, not years. Fluidic Intelligence is delivered through three integrated capabilities Fluidic Advisory Fluidic Forge Fluidic Teams Fluidic Advisory Our systems-thinking approach to AI transformation We help you identify friction points across your enterprise and discover the hidden knowledge that drives AI transformation. With our system thinkers embedded in your context, we map implicit knowledge assets, design intervention strategies, and define which capabilities to build and in what sequence. All to make your enterprise more fluid. Fluidic Forge Our field-tested AI accelerators to build your fluidic enterprise faster We don’t start from scratch, we start from experience. Our proprietary accelerators and platforms enable you to design, customize, and deploy AI solutions quickly and reliably. They extract decision patterns from historical data, build knowledge graphs from operational logs, create optimization engines for core processes, and design continuous feedback loops for improvement. These aren't generic tools; they are Nagarro's intellectual property , built and battle-tested through real-world enterprise deployments. Fluidic Teams Our AI-augmented engineers are equipped with intelligent agents . We do not just build with AI. We build alongside it. Our engineers are augmented with intelligent agents and trained to work in adaptive, AI-native environments. They know how to orchestrate AI workflows, validate outcomes in production, and design systems where human judgment and machine intelligence complement one another seamlessly. These are not traditional teams. They are Fluidic Teams, built for the era of augmented engineering. The result? Fluidic Intelligence enables engineers and AI agents to collaborate, combining human judgment and automation. Intelligence flows across the enterprise, driving at least a 20% uplift in productivity and speed. Fluidic Forge Accelerators Nagarro’s proprietary AI solutions for the enterprise NIA The agent engineering platform Builds production-ready intelligent agents, from document to workflow to knowledge agents, in a fraction of the time and effort.

        "From Engineering to Everything, AiDE ® transforms workflows, accelerates outcomes, and enables enterprises to become truly AI-native.",
        "Every aspect of ValueLabs runs on the Enterprise OS of AiDE ® , integrating our trained engineers with AiDE Agents while ensuring the outcomes are composed, orchestrated, and continuously improved. Brought to life by Agentic Intelligence, LLM Orchestration & Governance, Composable Architecture, Enterprise-grade Infrastructure, and Unified Systems of Intelligence.",
        "In complex enterprise environments, getting engineers up to speed can take weeks — and aligning them to coding standards can take months or even years. This slows your ability to launch new features. With AiDE ® , engineers can be productive from Day 1.",
        "Every new feature launch typically goes through product, UX, front-end and back-end development, testing, and DevOps. This time-tested process ensures reliable solutions at the cost of speed. With AiDE ® at every stage, letting experts review the output instead of building from scratch, we achieve speed to value.",
        "AiDE ® integrates with your product management platform, auto-generating wireframes, code, and test cases from user stories. You review, tweak, and go. Focus on ideas and go-to-market — AiDE ® handles quality and velocity.",
        "New developers can ask AiDE ® for help like they would a mentor. With enterprise coding standards and documentation automatically built in, everyone has an equal opportunity to build new features without adding to tech debt. Ask, review, accept — that’s all it takes.",
        "Converting complex business ideas into a stable enterprise platform takes time. The platform must also evolve with the target market’s changing needs. By using AiDE ® through the idea-to-launch pipeline, teams can focus on functional reviews, making the time and effort spent in building enterprises sustainable.",
        "Re-architecting a platform is a complex undertaking requiring deep understanding of both current and desired states. With AiDE ® , you can integrate your existing platform and transform each functionality into your approved target architecture, complete with functional and performance testing.",
        "As new code is committed, corresponding test cases are automatically updated and rerun, with detailed reports for further refinement by developers or testers. This ensures developers ship high-quality code, testers verify its security, and the team delivers a comprehensive, foolproof solution",
        "When the new code is submitted, AiDE ® automatically runs all relevant test scenarios and generates detailed review reports for both development and testing teams to refine further and expand upon. This flexibility supports user story adjustments while ensuring developers deliver secure, high-quality code and testers validate it as error-free, resulting in a fully reliable solution.",
        "With every code commit, AiDE ® identifies all potentially affected test cases and surfaces them for tester review. It also suggests updates, generates test scenarios, and provides production-grade test data, ensuring comprehensive test coverage at speed.",
        "As developers write and commit code, AiDE ® updates and re-runs all relevant test cases, generating detailed reports with suggested fixes. This enables developers to ship high-quality code, while testers ensure zero defect leakage, eliminating the potential for human error and ensuring a foolproof release.",
        "Automated data reconciliation checks at scale. Engineers can define all possible scenarios and enable data quality checks at every row and column level. These reconciliation checks can be embedded into data processing routines.",
        "Developed a business glossary for KPIs and attributes by leveraging AiDE Fabric and mapped attributes to the available reporting inventory. Aligned the KPIs and improved visibility into the reporting inventory, making it easy for users to search, consume, and act on the data products.",
        "A simple web interface that allows users to develop reports that drive visualization and insights, leading to actionable outcomes — in a self-serve manner. A semantic layer and business glossary make it easy for users to understand the available data for consumption.",
        "A conversational experience that allows users to communicate with data in natural language in a governed manner that leverages the business glossary, semantic layer, and AiDE Fabric capabilities to deliver the desired outcomes. The outcome of the conversations can then be consumed in tabular format and as summaries or reports.",
        "Automated security scanners focus on conducting the same set of security tests on an application that lacks the context of the application’s requirement. Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their security testing, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and containing logical flaws and privilege escalation issues.",
        "AiDE Shield utilizes GenAI to analyze vast amounts of security events, identify patterns and anomalies, and perform incident analysis in seconds. AI-powered threat hunting feature eliminates hidden threats within an enterprise.",
        "AiDE Aware enables organizations to prepare employees by customizing and launching simulated campaigns for the latest social engineering attacks. Using GenAI-driven simulations, our anti-phishing solution marks the new era of innovative, hyper-personalized training that will make your employees cybersecurity champions.",
        "Implement Agentic AI to enable elf-service across all user types (employers, employees, carriers, brokers), automating platform tasks while maintaining human oversight for review, approval, and editing. This aligns operations with SaaS standards and establishes a compelling AI narrative for stakeholders and private equity owners.",
        "Reimagine technology architecture and UX principles to enable direct consumer bookings with a conversational experience. Integrate text/speech features for diverse demographics, dynamic corporate rules with Agentic AI, and conversational UX to deliver a comprehensive B2C travel platform.",
        "Implement Agentic AI to automate custom product creation steps and provide intelligent recommendations. This streamlined workflow reduces user effort, speeds up the creation process, and boosts customer retention through enhanced experience and increased engagement.",
        "For rapid prototyping that prioritizes concept demonstration over enterprise-level robustness, simply input your needs. Watch as an interactive prototype is automatically crafted, enabling direct user engagement. This prototype can be made accessible through a unique URL or incorporated into your existing platform or application, facilitating user feedback.",
        "For quick pilots that need to convey your ideas effectively rather than being enterprise-grade, AiDE ® can convert your requirements into functional prototypes in less than a week. Users can experience your vision almost in real-time and provide feedback, which can be used to determine product market fit.",
        "Integrate your front-end codebase, describe your desired revamp, and upload any UX files. AiDE ® will generate the new front-end. Once reviewed and approved, the associated back-end code and test pipelines will be generated to ensure a functioning and stable platform post-revamp.",
        "With every code commit, AiDE ® identifies all potentially affected test cases and flags them for review. It also provides suggestions for updating test cases to ensure fast, comprehensive testing.",
        "Legacy codebases can be integrated to create all functional and in-line documentation automatically. Dependencies between different files can be identified and stored, so new joiners can ask questions directly, similar to how they would ask a mentor. Every code commit alerts all files and methods that need to be reviewed to ensure the code compiles.",
        "Connect your existing legacy codebase and choose the target version. AiDE ® breaks down all planned syntax changes and highlights bugs and vulnerabilities to be addressed in the upgrade. Functional and performance testing are included, ensuring a smooth, reliable transition.",
        "Modernizing your platform architecture demands expertise in both its current and future states. You can integrate your existing platform with AiDE ® to enhance functionality and architecture and enable functional and performance testing. This streamlines complex re-architectures without disrupting operations.",
        "We have integrated Agentic AI into everything we do and that has transformed how we see problems and tackle them.",
        "Let us know the business impact you want to create, and we’d love to help on your journey!",

Need visibility into which test cases will be impacted by code changes? SOLUTION With every code commit, AiDE ® identifies all potentially affected test cases and surfaces them for tester review. It also suggests updates, generates test scenarios, and provides production-grade test data, ensuring comprehensive test coverage at speed. GAPS Aiming for zero user complaints from platform glitches? Looking to identify and address review areas without room for manual oversight? Aiming for zero user complaints on platform glitches? SOLUTION As developers write and commit code, AiDE ® updates and re-runs all relevant test cases, generating detailed reports with suggested fixes. This enables developers to ship high-quality code, while testers ensure zero defect leakage, eliminating the potential for human error and ensuring a foolproof release. Data and Analytics 1/4 GAPS High turnaround time for delivering a trusted data platform? Lack of analytics adoption due to missing or incomplete data? SOLUTION Automated data reconciliation checks at scale. Engineers can define all possible scenarios and enable data quality checks at every row and column level. These reconciliation checks can be embedded into data processing routines. GAPS Lack of organizational alignment on KPIs and attributes? Missing data literacy and awareness of inventory? SOLUTION Developed a business glossary for KPIs and attributes by leveraging AiDE Fabric and mapped attributes to the available reporting inventory. Aligned the KPIs and improved visibility into the reporting inventory, making it easy for users to search, consume, and act on the data products. GAPS Complexity of tools leading to poor adoption? Delayed time-to-insights due to high dependency on IT? SOLUTION A simple web interface that allows users to develop reports that drive visualization and insights, leading to actionable outcomes — in a self-serve manner. A semantic layer and business glossary make it easy for users to understand the available data for consumption. GAPS Delay in responding to ad-hoc questions on data? Limited bandwidth delaying the delivery of reports? SOLUTION A conversational experience that allows users to communicate with data in natural language in a governed manner that leverages the business glossary, semantic layer, and AiDE Fabric capabilities to deliver the desired outcomes. The outcome of the conversations can then be consumed in tabular format and as summaries or reports. Cybersecurity 1/3 GAPS Standard security testing missing out on the requirements context? Unable to identify logical flaws in your application with security testing? Increasing costs of fixing security issues post-deployment? SOLUTION Automated security scanners focus on conducting the same set of security tests on an application that lacks the context of the application’s requirement. Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their security testing, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and containing logical flaws and privilege escalation issues. GAPS Incident responders getting overwhelmed by a high volume of alerts from various security tools and systems, resulting in alert fatigue? Complex threat alerts making it difficult for analysts to understand the severity and impact of the alert? Inefficient & slow threat hunting allowing threat actors to remain undetected in enterprise environments? SOLUTION AiDE Shield utilizes GenAI to analyze vast amounts of security events, identify patterns and anomalies, and perform incident analysis in seconds. AI-powered threat hunting feature eliminates hidden threats within an enterprise. GAPS Phishing campaigns are using stale information to perform awareness campaigns? Employees getting similar content, leading to dull and ineffective learning outcomes? Human risk factors getting overlooked when designing security controls for the enterprise? SOLUTION AiDE Aware enables organizations to prepare employees by customizing and launching simulated campaigns for the latest social engineering attacks. Using GenAI-driven simulations, our anti-phishing solution marks the new era of innovative, hyper-personalized training that will make your employees cybersecurity champions.

SOLUTION Implement Agentic AI to enable elf-service across all user types (employers, employees, carriers, brokers), automating platform tasks while maintaining human oversight for review, approval, and editing. This aligns operations with SaaS standards and establishes a compelling AI narrative for stakeholders and private equity owners.

Need to keep the excitement for your solution alive within your target market? SOLUTION For quick pilots that need to convey your ideas effectively rather than being enterprise-grade, AiDE ® can convert your requirements into functional prototypes in less than a week. Users can experience your vision almost in real-time and provide feedback, which can be used to determine product market fit. Revamp or Re-design your Platform UI 1/1 GAPS Platform starting to feel outdated and in need of a fresh design? Are users finding it difficult to traverse through the platform? Does your current team have no bandwidth to take up platform revamp initiatives? SOLUTION Integrate your front-end codebase, describe your desired revamp, and upload any UX files. AiDE ® will generate the new front-end. Once reviewed and approved, the associated back-end code and test pipelines will be generated to ensure a functioning and stable platform post-revamp. Ensure Comprehensive Testing with Every Code Change 1/1 GAPS Looking to speed up the process of identifying and updating relevant tests? Would you like to prioritize test cases intelligently for regression testing? Looking to reduce the time taken to identify which test cases need to be reviewed and updated when a code is committed and pushed for testing? SOLUTION With every code commit, AiDE ® identifies all potentially affected test cases and flags them for review. It also provides suggestions for updating test cases to ensure fast, comprehensive testing. Reducing Person-reliance in Legacy Codebase 1/1 GAPS Concerned about single points of failure because senior employees haven’t documented or shared critical knowledge? Employees struggling to document and share knowledge, hindering effective training for new team members? SOLUTION Legacy codebases can be integrated to create all functional and in-line documentation automatically. Dependencies between different files can be identified and stored, so new joiners can ask questions directly, similar to how they would ask a mentor. Every code commit alerts all files and methods that need to be reviewed to ensure the code compiles. AiDE Migrate 1/1 GAPS Been a while since you upgraded your tech? Want to proactively address vulnerabilities that may creep into your platform due to older tech versioning? Get your existing team to balance platform run and change simultaneously? SOLUTION Connect your existing legacy codebase and choose the target version. AiDE ® breaks down all planned syntax changes and highlights bugs and vulnerabilities to be addressed in the upgrade. Functional and performance testing are included, ensuring a smooth, reliable transition. AiDE Modernize 1/1 GAPS Seeing signs that your platform needs refresh and performance optimization? Looking to address vulnerabilities that may have crept onto your platform? Suspecting redundant code that can be optimized because features are being built by different teams at rapid speed? Need to future-proof your platform for the next five years? SOLUTION Modernizing your platform architecture demands expertise in both its current and future states. You can integrate your existing platform with AiDE ® to enhance functionality and architecture and enable functional and performance testing. This streamlines complex re-architectures without disrupting operations. Testimonials Hear what our clients have to say about us!
