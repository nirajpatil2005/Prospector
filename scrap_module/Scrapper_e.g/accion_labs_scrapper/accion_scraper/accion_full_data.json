We provide end to end innovation and product engineering services for our customers.” Further, Accion Labs’ global presence also allows them to tap into newer markets and a wider talent pool.", "To stay ahead of the competition, Accion Labs has created seven Centers of Excellence (CoE) as part of its Accion Innovation Center (AIC). These centers are built around Innovation Development, Human-Computer Science, DevSecOps, Cloud Computing, Data Analytics, Technology Architecture, and Operations Management. “We have several architects representing these centers of excellence whose primary responsibility is to keep an eye out and play around with emerging technologies to quickly gain familiarity, expertise, and establish best practices,” states Thakkar.“Our architects also work with clients in an advisory capacity to permeate these best practices that can help customers build software faster or better. Backed by a Private Equity firm—TA Associates, Accion Labs has exponentially grown over the last decade and will continue to expand organically and inorganically into newer technology areas and geographies as they enter 2022. “You can expect some strategic acquisitions that will help us accentuate and expand our value proposition in the industry,” concludes Thakkar."]},

As Eli Goldratt, father of the Theory of Constraints aptly remarks, any technology can bring about benefits if and only if it diminishes a limitation. In the absence of the new technology, he contends, organizations develop modes of behavior, measurements and policies that inadvertently tend to accommodate the limitation. That’s precisely why the new technology will invariably fail to deliver benefits unless the organization acknowledges and acts upon the need to change their modes of behavior, measurements and policies. Goldratt’s astute observation applies to Big Data technologies as well.", "For example, it’s now possible to analyze reams of data about individual customer behavior when measured through digital and mobile technology. Now, there are organizations that use Big Data to measure the effectiveness of conventional marketing campaigns that were designed only to “spray and pray”. Obviously, there will be no benefits. Before they expect big data to deliver on its promise, they need to design intelligent, dynamically targeted marketing models that leverage the capabilities of Big Data - and that is not easy. Umpteen Big Data implementations prove self-defeating on this very count.", "Yes absolutely. Machine Learning is not a magic potion that can solve all problems automatically. Over-fitting due to noisy data is a common occurrence. The more the uncertainty in the prediction criteria, the higher is the amount of noise in the data. The trick is in separating the noise from the signal. For Machine Learning to be useful, it requires data scientists to have a more holistic understanding of the problem domain. Without that, the temptation is to design overly complex models that are susceptible to problems such as over-fitting. With holistic understanding, the models become leaner and thereby more accurate in their predictions. Whether this holistic understanding can be achieved by collaboration between mathematicians and computer scientists with domain experts such as economists remains to be verified.", "A holistic educational syllabus will go a long way in enabling data scientists to have a multi-disciplinary understanding of their chosen domains. We are already seeing the emergence of curricula such as liberal arts where students can combine subjects from multiple disciplines across business, science and commerce. Going forward, educational institutions would need to find ways to move away from their industrial roots to address a larger number of segments that are prevalent, and even dominant, in today’s global market place. Education cannot be limited to a point-in-time learning process - it is by its very nature continuous and ongoing. Hence, we need to create and institutionalize educational models that enable such continued learning with the same efficacy that that conventional 10+2+3 learning delivers today.", "As the volume of data increases, common erroneous data points lose their significance. Analytical models are supposed to account for such anomalies and hence lean models that are built with the knowledge of the subject matter are less susceptible to problems like overfitting. I do not think that an increase in the volume of data will make data cleaning or curation more important or significant.", "Each of these technologies and methodologies has a distinct role to play. They complement each other. There are some overlaps of course, but we often come across situations where the best solution to the problem may not necessarily be warranted unless the value delivered is sufficient to justify the investment. None of these technologies is cost-effective or easy to implement. They all involve change management and that is far more difficult and expensive than implementing the technical solution. Hence it is best to avoid getting into a hype trap and make an objective decision about which solution adequately addresses the given problem or need.", "At heart, I am a very simple technology person. Occasionally, I do enjoy reading about grand ideas (Asimov with his psychohistory is my all time favorite) but my head is invariably over-occupied with solution-finding to problems and challenges that I can address in my lifetime. Customers today demand continuous integration and deployment of their solutions, which means innovation cycles are very short and demand delivery of workable results almost immediately. So I would steer clear of debating on what’s possible and what’s not, whether in the realm of Machine Learning or any other Learning.", "I hated Mathematics in school. I got 3 marks out of 100 in class 7 after which my parents gently coaxed me into joining a boarding school where I sort of wizened up. But my real exposure to the Mathematics as I see it today came only during my first year of B.Sc. That’s when I really found that Mathematics was not just fiddling with funny formulae but a structured way of rational thought. I started learning Mathematics in the form of pictures and diagrams. I loved it so much that I thought I should do something more concrete with it. Having cleared IIT JEE, I chose to do a five-year integrated course in Mathematics from IIT Kanpur. That was where I was exposed to the fascinating world of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition under the guidance of Prof. R.K.S Rathore. (", "). He gave fresh insights into the wonderful chemistry between Mathematics and images.", "After my graduation, I had to make the customary choice between doing further studies or taking up a job. Neither seemed attractive to me. I craved for doing something that used Mathematics in the real world.

There are 22 employees at the Upper St. Clair office and about 40 embedded with various client offices downtown. Accion Labs has expanded to include more than 900 employees in offices across the United States and around the world including India, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and Britain.

Sukumaran, along with Chief Executive Officer Kinesh Doshi and Senior Vice President for Sales Tony Kernan, created Accion Labs in 2011. They all had experience in the information technology industry, but Kernan says nobody takes their success for granted. “We still have a startup mentality,” he says. “We don’t feel like we’ve arrived. I still walk in here as nervous as I was the first day.” Clients usually come to Accion Labs with a software design and ask the company to develop, implement and test it. “We help clients realize their ideas,” Sukumaran says.", "Although Accion Labs’ employees work in offices around the world, innovations in communications technology allow clients to hold meetings every morning with Accion Labs’ software engineers. This means the firm can be very responsive to a client’s needs, which is important because product requirements can change in the span of a few hours. “The client is still the captain of the ship,” Sukumaran says. “You can almost touch and feel employees, even if they aren’t sitting across the table from you.” Halter says being responsive is essential for success. “In the technology industry, time is like dog years,” she says. “One hour for us feels more like seven hours.”", "Despite the company’s success, Sukumaran notes that there is still a lot to accomplish. Future goals include opening a new office in Europe and staying on the cutting edge of technology. Accion Labs created an innovation center last year and Kernan says the company’s Chief Technology Officer, Asustoh Bijoor, will help clients understand where new technologies are going. Sukumaran also wants the company to contribute more open-source software, so that anyone can use Accion Labs’ ideas. Other plans include expanding the company’s presence in the United States and allowing entrepreneurs to open “franchises” under the Accion Labs name. Kernan, Halter and Sukumaran have learned several lessons in the last five years. Kernan says it’s important to discover which opportunities are worth pursuing and which are not. “It can be painful to walk away from an opportunity, but it can be more painful to chase one you shouldn’t,” he explains. He and Halter agree that it’s important to maintain a healthy work-life balance.", "Employees at Accion Labs’ Upper St. Clair office sometimes play cornhole outside or let their children run wild in the courtyard when they visit on “take your child to work” day. Instead of worrying about the competition, Sukumaran suggests that entrepreneurs focus on what they can accomplish.

Finally, Halter says the journey is more important than the destination: “Focus on where you are right now, not where you hope to be. Otherwise, you might slip and fall or stumble.”"]},
